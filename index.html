    <p class="paragraph1"> Hello people , I am priyal sinha founder and CEO of APNA LOAD . Apna Load is a logistics service provider company . Which is end to end business to business logistics market place. Where our vision is to organise the unorganised logistics freight industry . In the last 7-8 years truck industrys are grown very much , but transportation industry isnt grown 20% comparing to the last 10 to 15 years traditional style. In this industry getting load is much inconvinent similar to past . So to strimeline this process we are launching apna load . Where we are solving big problems of truckers & transporters . Like no load , no consistency , not getting paid well for there efforts and many more.</p>

    <p class="paragraph2">

        our mission at apna load is to grow the small fleet owner and compet in market without sacrificing the profits , as per our past 10year survey we found that more than 80% small scale fleet owners are just running their business at breakeven point can you imagin they are not actually making profit to pay the EMI or service cost o the vehical . the reason behind this was a very big competition because of competition the truck owners are ready to do the work for very less price and that made a cycle and that cycle is running from  decades.</p>
